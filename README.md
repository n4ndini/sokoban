# Sokoban 📦

### Getting Started 💻
1. Run the program in your terminal (./sokoban)
2. Set up your level using the commands b (box), w (wall), s (storage) and W (line of wall). (PS enter the coords you want for entity as well)
3. Set up your player start location
4. Play the game!!! (wasd commands for moving, r to reset the game to original state, c to show the number of moves made)
5. Once all boxes are on a storage location, you have won the game!


### FYI:
- played in the terminal
- goal is to move all boxes to a storage location
- player and box movement is wrapped (aka can move out of bounds, the player will just appear on the other side of board)
- multiple moves can be made at once (e.g. entering wwwww will move the player 5 spaces up as long as the move is valid)
- only moveable entities are the player and boxes
